A CSS library that provides classes to work with Responsive Grid Layout.

## Documentation

Documentation and tutorial on how to use it can be found [here](https://nimbus.tec.br/css-library). We didn't put it here in README.md because it would take up a lot of space.

## How to use?

##### CDN

To use the CSS file via CDN, or if you prefer, you can use the auto-import file (JS) via CDN, it can be done this way:

[Unpkg CSS](https://unpkg.com/@vlalg-nimbus/chameleon-grid-layout/dist/chameleon-grid-layout.min.css) / [Unpkg JS](https://unpkg.com/@vlalg-nimbus/chameleon-grid-layout/dist/chameleon-grid-layout.min.js)

Links:

```js
https://unpkg.com/@vlalg-nimbus/chameleon-grid-layout/dist/chameleon-grid-layout.min.css

// or

https://unpkg.com/@vlalg-nimbus/chameleon-grid-layout/dist/chameleon-grid-layout.min.js
```

##### To install

```bash
npm i @vlalg-nimbus/chameleon-grid-layout
```

or

```bash

yarn add @vlalg-nimbus/chameleon-grid-layout

```

To use, just import the CSS file. I do not recommend using the auto import file (IIFE), this avoids possible conflicts if your system does not support IIFE.

```js
import '@vlalg-nimbus/chameleon-grid-layout/dist/chameleon-grid-layout.min.css'
```

## Browser support

These were some of the browsers tested:

- Chrome
- Edge
- Firefox ESR+
- Internet Explorer 10+
- Safari 8+
- Opera

I didn't mention the all versions, but I guarantee that it works correctly in 99% of browsers that have already been previously tested. The tests were carried out on [browserling](https://www.browserling.com) and [browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com).
