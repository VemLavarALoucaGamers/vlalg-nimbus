# Nimbus Playground

This project is a playground for the **vuejs 3 components** that are also here within this project in the `src/components/NAME` folder.

## Commands

The only commands that this central component project (playground) has are:

- `dev`
- `build`
- `preview`

Even though we used a **VV** (vuejs + vite) project template, there are no pages to be loaded in the project other than those that [Histoire](https://histoire.dev) generates to set up the playground.

Each component located in `src/components/NAME` already has a complete structure for development and testing, each with its own configurations, even if they are a copy and paste of each other, just changing the components and some configurations. This was done so that everyone could have their own little world, making testing and maintenance easier.

Look at the `README.md` of each component to find out about it and the `package.json` to find out the commands that need to be run to develop, maintain, test and publish them.

The commands for this **playground** are:

##### DEV
```sh
yarn dev
```

##### BUILD
```sh
yarn build
```

##### PREVIEW
```sh
yarn preview
```
