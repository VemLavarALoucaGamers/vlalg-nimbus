# JS Libraries

They are libs created to be used in projects that use JavaScript as a language, whether it be Vanilla or Node.js.

Don't forget the [main focus](/nimbus#main-focus) of creating these components.

## Tests

The libs were not tested (unit test), as they are a bit complex and have been in use for a long time, the tests were left for an upcoming update of this project.

These libs listed below have all been well tested in the past when this project was not thought of, for this reason it can be used without any fear.
