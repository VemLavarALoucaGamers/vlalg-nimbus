# Vue.js Components

These are components created to be used in projects that use <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js 3</a>.

Don't forget the [main focus](/nimbus#main-focus) of creating these components.

To test with components, use session [Playground](/playground).

## Components list

List of components that have already been created and their status of publishing for use.

This list does not contain the internal components, look at the list below to find out what the internal components are.

| Status | Name | Version | NPM link | Downloads |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <span class="icon-lib-status icon-check"> :icon{name="material-symbols:check-circle-outline-rounded"}</span> | nb-payments | :badge[v2.0.0] | <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vlalg-nimbus/nb-payments" target="_blank">NPM</a> | <span class="npm-badge">![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/@vlalg-nimbus/nb-payments?style=plastic)</span> |

## Detailed list

This list contains the internal components.

::list{type="success"}
- **nb-payments**: It is a collection of components aimed at those who work with payment methods.
  ::list{type="success"}
    - [nb-credit-card](/vue-components/nb-payments/nb-credit-card): This lib replaces the use of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vemlavaraloucagamers/vg-credit-card" target="_blank">vg-credit-card</a>.

## List of old components

Components that are still being brought into the project.

::list{type="warning"}
- vg-delete-button
- vg-countdown
- vg-text
  ::list{type="warning"}
    - vg-gradient-text
    - vg-highlight-selected-text
  ::
::

These components can already be used following the old project, [here](https://github.com/VemLavarALoucaGamers/vlalg-components-libs/tree/main)! But I recommend waiting for the republication here on Nimbus to avoid future headaches migrating versions in your personal projects.

## Tests

The components are still being developed and have not been tested (component testing), as they are not complex components, it is not so much a problem to leave it for a next update of this project.

These components listed below have all been well tested in the past when this project was not thought of, for this reason it can be used without any fear.
::list{type="primary"}
- vg-delete-button
- vg-countdown
- vg-credit-card
- vg-text
  ::list{type="primary"}
    - vg-gradient-text
    - vg-highlight-selected-text
