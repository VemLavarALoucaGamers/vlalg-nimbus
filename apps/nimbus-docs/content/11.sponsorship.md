# Sponsorship

For now the financial support for the project is closed, just until the release of version :badge[v1.0.0], not much time is left for this to happen.

As soon as it becomes available, we will be offering some forms of financial support.

It is worth mentioning that the purpose of the project is not to raise money, we do not aim for that, but it happens quite often that someone wants to support it, this means that the work is being recognized in a good way and that development and maintenance must be maintained.

If you reached this page, it's because you want to help the project even in this initial phase, if you really want to, get in touch with Tonhão Santos.

Thank you very much, the VLALG team greatly appreciates your support.

## LIVE

This session is dedicated to people who appear frequently in <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tonhaosantos" target="_blank">@tonhaosantos Twitch lives</a> when this project is being developed. But it is worth noting that it is only for people who appear frequently and interact, this is considered to be one of the ways to support the project, even if indirectly.
