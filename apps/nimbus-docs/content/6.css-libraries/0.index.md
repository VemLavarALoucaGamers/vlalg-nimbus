# CSS Library

They are libs created to be used in projects that use CSS, that is, frontend projects.

Don't forget the [main focus](/nimbus#main-focus) of creating these libs.

## Browser support

These were some of the browsers tested:

::list{type="success"}
- Chrome
- Edge
- Firefox ESR+
- Internet Explorer 10+
- Safari 8+
- Opera
::

I didn't mention the all versions, but I guarantee that it works correctly in 99% of browsers that have already been previously tested. The tests were carried out on [browserling](https://www.browserling.com) and [browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com).
