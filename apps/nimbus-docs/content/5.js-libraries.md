⚠️ This list will still change, the libs that are listed were developed outside the scope of this project and are being brought in little by little

# JS Libraries

They are libs created to be used in projects that use JavaScript as a language, whether it be Vanilla or Node.js.

Don't forget the [main focus](/nimbus#main-focus) of creating these components.

## Libs List

List of libs that have already been created and their status of publishing for use.

- <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vlalg-nimbus/raven-sentinel" target="_blank">Raven Sentinel</a> :badge[v1.0.0]
- awesome-consolelog

These libs can already be used following the old project, [here](https://github.com/VemLavarALoucaGamers/vlalg-components-libs/tree/main) and [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vemlavaraloucagamers/awesome-consolelog)! But I recommend waiting for the republication here on Nimbus to avoid future headaches migrating versions in your personal projects.

## Tests

The libs were not tested (unit test), as they are a bit complex and have been in use for a long time, the tests were left for an upcoming update of this project.

These libs listed below have all been well tested in the past when this project was not thought of, for this reason it can be used without any fear.
