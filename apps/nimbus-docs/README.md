This project uses Nuxt 3 with [Docus](https://docus.dev).

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Development

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Edge Side Rendering

Can be deployed to Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions, AWS, and most Node-compatible environments.

## Static Generation

Use the `generate` command to build your application.

The HTML files will be generated in the .output/public directory and ready to be deployed to any static compatible hosting.

```bash
yarn generate
```

You might want to preview the result of your build locally, to do so, run the following command:

```bash
yarn preview
```
